    description:
      "I really wish Spotify can enable users to access all the previous years' Spotify Wrapped stories and statistics (since joining the app), to see information including minutes listened and the top 5 artsists and songs. Currently, we are only able to search for our previous years' top songs, but I think it would honestly be amazing to look back at stats of the Wrapped for the new year compared to previous years, would be a lovely feature and track record for personal memories and to share them with friends. I hope Spotify can seriously consider adding this.",
